# Blender Style PyQt5 Components

This project consists of custom PyQt5 components inspired by the internal components of Blender. These components have been redesigned and restyled to mimic Blender's unique appearance and functionality.

## Features

- **Blender-style design**: The components are styled to resemble Blender's internal UI elements.
- **Custom components**: Various custom components have been created, including buttons, switches, and line edits, each with enhanced functionality.
- **PyQt5 based**: Built using PyQt5, ensuring compatibility with PyQt5 applications.

## Installation

To install and use these custom components in your project, you need to have PyQt5 installed. You can install PyQt5 using pip:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git
git clone https://github.com/JIA-WEI-LI/WBlender-Style-Widget.git
```

## Usage

Below is an example of how to use the PushButton component in a PyQt5 application:
```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QVBoxLayout, QWidget
from wblenderstylewidget import *

app = QApplication([])

window = QWidget()
layout = QVBoxLayout()

push_button = PushButton(text="Click Me", icon="path/to/icon.png", corner_radius=5)
layout.addWidget(push_button)

window.setLayout(layout)
window.show()

app.exec_()
```
